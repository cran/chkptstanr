#' chkptstanr: Checkpoint MCMC Sampling with 'Stan'
#' 
#' @description Fit Bayesian models in \strong{Stan} \insertCite{carpenter2017stan}{chkptstanr} 
#' with checkpointing, that is, the ability to stop the MCMC sampler at will, 
#' and then pick right back up where the MCMC sampler left off. Custom \strong{Stan} models
#' can be fitted, or the popular package \strong{brms} \insertCite{burkner2017brms}{chkptstanr} 
#' can be used to generate the \strong{Stan} code. This package is fully compatible with the 
#' \code{R} packages \href{http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/}{\strong{brms}}, 
#' \href{https://mc-stan.org/posterior/}{\strong{posterior}}, 
#' \href{https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/}{\strong{cmdstanr}}, and 
#' \href{https://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/}{\strong{bayesplot}}. 
#' 
#' There are a variety of use cases for \strong{chkptstanr}, 
#' including (but not limited to) the following:
#' 
#' \itemize{
#' 
#' \item The primary motivation for developing  \strong{chkptstanr} is to
#' reduce the cost of fitting models with \strong{Stan} when using, say, AWS,
#' and in particular by taking advantage of so-called \emph{spot instances}.  
#' These instances are "a cost-effective choice if you can be flexible about 
#' when your applications run and if your applications can be 
#' \emph{interrupted} \[emphasis added\]"  
#' (\href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html}{(AWS website)}).
#' 
#' \strong{chkptstanr} thus allows for taking advantage of spot instances by 
#' enabling "interruptions" during model fitting. This can reduce the cost
#' by 90 %.
#' 
#' 
#' \item \strong{Stan} allows for fitting complex models. This often entails 
#' iteratively improving the model to ensure that the MCMC algorithm
#' has converged. Typically this requires waiting until the model has 
#' \emph{finished sampling}, and then assessing MCMC diagnostics (e.g., R-hat).
#' 
#' \strong{chkptstanr} can be used to make iterative model building more 
#' efficient, e.g., by having the ability to pause sampling and examine the model 
#' (e.g., convergence diagnostics), and then deciding to stop sampling or to continue on.
#' 
#' 
#' 
#' \item Computationally intensive models can sometimes take several days to 
#'       finish up. When using a personal computer, this can take up all 
#'       the computing resources.
#'       
#' \strong{chkptstanr} can be used with scheduling, such that the model is fitted 
#' during certain windows (e.g., at night, weekends, etc.)
#' 
#' \item Those familiar with Bayesian methods will know all too well that a model can take 
#' longer than expected. This can be problematic when there is another task
#' that needs to be completed, because one is faced with
#'  waiting it out or stopping the model (and loosing all of the progress).
#'  
#'  \strong{chkptstanr} makes it so that models can be conveniently stopped 
#'  if need be, while not loosing any of the progress.
